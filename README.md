# fake_news_detection_propagation

This is the repository containing my code for the paper 'Fake News Detection on Twitter using Propagation Structures' published in Springer for the Misdoom 2020 Conference. Read full paper here : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-61841-4_10 

GDLtopk-GraphConv contains the code for my Geometric Deep Learning model, while ManualExtractionFeatures contains the code related to the statistical analysis of the difference in propagation between true and fake news graphs.
